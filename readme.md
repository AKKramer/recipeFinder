# Recipe Finder from Ingredients on hand. 

Everyone has those nights that you need to cook something but don't know what to make. We decided to create a solution for that dilemma with our webapp. We give the user the ability to search for recipes using just the ingredients that they have on hand. The more specific the list, the more the results will get narrowed down for the user. The user also has the ability to remove certain food groups based on allergies or intolerances they may have to certain foods. There is also the option to choose specific diet programs for the recipes to fit into. There is also a drink option that can be searched for or recommended to the user based on certain search criteria. 

## Technologies 

The main API behind our project was spoonacular. It is a highly robust food API. It provides many endpoints, to solve many different problems. We decided to just use three different methods from spoonacular. We could develop this much further with more time, and continued growth in our knowledge. 

Our second API used was cocktailDB. This API is not as robust, but provides different cocktails. 

A new technology that we explored was slimselect. This is robust js library for dropdown menus. We were able to use this to implement our drop down menus for our food restrictions entered by the user. There are many more options to choose from, but we did not need them for our application. 

## Further development

There are many things that we could do for further development, but the top three for right now are:
    1. Using more endpoints from spoonacular to give the user more options and fuller experience. 
    2. Continue to develop the website to be more responsive and a better experience across all platforms. 
    3. Taking the recipe and print it within our own site instead of taking the user away from our site.
